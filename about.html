        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory Data Curation Working Group (DCWG) first convened
            in the spring of 2023.
            This group was proposed at the 2022 DOE Data Days in response to the challenges posed by the
            exponential growth in data generation across the diverse landscape of United States National
            Laboratory complex.
            The surge in data volume, the velocity of its production, and the grand diversity of data types
            have prompted the need for a dedicated consortium to tackle the complex data-related issues
            faced by these laboratories. Cognizant of these challenges, and the need for a systematic
            approach to tackling them, led a group of curators, librarians, information scientists,
            researchers, and developers representing the different laboratories to form a working group to
            identify emerging issues and share expertise in data curation.</p>
        <h3 id="about" class="mt-4">Goals</h3>
        <p>The DOE Data Curation Working Group (DOE DCWG) addresses the full data lifecycle—from management planning and early scientist engagement to establishing curation standards, tools, literacy materials, repository best practices, and citation-level metadata harvesting protocols aligned with 
            <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"> FAIR principles</a>.
            As a strategic, cross-functional body, the DCWG pursues initiatives asynchronously throughout the year, implementing data curation best practices adapted for DOE National Laboratories. By sharing this model, we aim to exchange challenges and successes with the broader data curation community and receive feedback on our efforts.
        </p>

<h3 id="objectives" class="mt-4">Previous Year's Work</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Developed best practices for liaison work and training</li>
    <li>Developed a <a href="https://osf.io/4kgjm/files/q93kz">primer for telemetry data</a> in collaboration with our partners at Data Curation Network (DCN)</li>
    <li>Collaborated with DOE OSTI (Office of Scientific and Technical Information) on maturing the data sharing plan and discovery layer</li>
