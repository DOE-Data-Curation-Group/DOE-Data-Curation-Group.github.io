        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory Data Curation Working Group (DCWG) first convened
            in the spring of 2023.
            This group was proposed at the 2022 DOE Data Days in response to the challenges posed by the
            exponential growth in data generation across the diverse landscape of United States National
            Laboratory complex.
            The surge in data volume, the velocity of its production, and the grand diversity of data types
            have prompted the need for a dedicated consortium to tackle the complex data-related issues
            faced by these laboratories. Cognizant of these challenges, and the need for a systematic
            approach to tackling them, led a group of curators, librarians, information scientists,
            researchers, and developers representing the different laboratories to form a working group to
            identify emerging issues and share expertise in data curation.</p>
        <h3 id="about" class="mt-4">Our Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal of the DOE Data Curation Working Group (DOE DCWG) is to address the full lifecycle of
            data--from data management planning
            and ensuring early liaison engagement with scientists to establishing data curation standards and tools,
            data literacy materials, and repository best practices as well as citation-level metadata harvesting
            protocols as informed by the
            <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"> FAIR data principles</a>.
            As a strategic, cross-functional decision-making entity, the DCWG identified
            <a href="#objectives">7 objectives</a> that members work asynchronously on
            throughout the fiscal year.
            This allows the group to focus on implementing data curation best practices that are adapted to the DOE
            National Laboratories environment. By sharing this model, we hope to share our challenges and successes
            and receive feedback from the larger data curation community on the efforts of the working group.
        </p>
        <h3 id="objectives" class="mt-4">Seven Objectives of the DCWG</h2>
            <li> Work with DOE OSTI (Office of Scientific and Technical Information) to come up with a more mature
                data sharing plan and discovery layer</li>
            <li> Research and implement metadata and ontologies that improve discovery and interoperability at the
                general and specialist/disciplinary level</li>
            <li> Develop a "Data Curator Toolkit" to help curators asses datasets when they are too large to curate
                manually</li>
            <li> Develop best practices for Machine Actionable Data Management Plans that reflect the needs of the
                laboratories</li>
            <li> Develop best practices for liaison work and training</li>
            <li> In collaboration with our partners at Data Curation Network (DCN) create documentation and primers
                for curators</li>
            <li> Machine Learning - Create scripts and/or a proof-of-concept short paper that demonstrates how
                accessing various repository metadata can allow for semantic search capabilities</li>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Laboratories with participating members</h3>
